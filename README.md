# justlistn

This is a community project to create a webapp that lets people pick a song to listen to and then provide all the following songs that would provide a perfect flow based on audio fingerprinting.

## Contributing
If you want to commit a change then open a Pull Request and I'll review it. You need a 'looks good to me' or an 'lgtm' from me to merge the branch. This will likely change in the long run and others will be able to lgtm PRs too as we get more people.

## Running it locally
For now, simply open `index.html` in the website folder . This will change as the app evolves and becomes an actual app.
