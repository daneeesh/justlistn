# justlistn

This is a community project to create a webapp that lets people pick a song to listen to and then provide all the following songs that would provide a perfect flow based on audio fingerprinting.

If you want to commit a change then open a Pull Request and I'll review it. You need a 'looks good to me' or an 'lgtm' from me to merge the branch (this might change in the long run and others will be able to lgtm PRs too).
